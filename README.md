from (http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/setting-up-an-ember-app-with-a-rails-backend)

This is a barebones app created to provide people with a working example of an Ember app using Ember Data, Rails, and Active Model Serializers. 

You can clone this repo and setup the app like so:

````
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
````

Please feel free to submit a pull request if you would like add more functionality to this app.
